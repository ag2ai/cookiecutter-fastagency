# Cookiecutter FastAgency

Cookiecutter template for developing with FastAgency.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this Cookiecutter template, please make sure you have the `cookiecutter` package installed. If it's not installed, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

## Getting Started

To create a new FastAgency project using this template, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to generate a new FastAgency project:

   ```bash
   cookiecutter https://github.com/ag2ai/cookiecutter-fastagency.git
   ```

   This command will prompt you to provide some information about your project, such as the project name, author name, and other configuration options.

3. After you've answered the prompts, Cookiecutter will create a new directory for your FastAgency project based on your responses.

4. Inside the newly generated directory, you will find a README file specific to your project. Follow the instructions in that README file to set up and run your FastAgency application.

5. That's it! You now have a new FastAgency project set up and ready to go. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please refer to the project-specific README file or reach out to the project maintainers.
